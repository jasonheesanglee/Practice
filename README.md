# Practice
This is a practice repository for myself

Resigned previous job in Feb 2023, and started working on Python since 20th Feb 2023.

For now, I don't even know how to use github, but I believe one day I will be fluent.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Record from 15th Mar 2023.
I'm still not fluent with github.

This is what I have been doing.

âœ… Completed Crash Course on Python (Free ver.)

âœ… Completed PY4E (The whole course, thanks to Naver Boost Course)

ðŸ§­ Working on AI Basics (The whole course, thanks to Naver Boost Course as well)

Record from 25th Mar 2023.
I took no further effort on learning Github so far.

I will be joining Year-Dream School, an AI education bootcamp organized by Korean Government.
It will be starting from coming Monday (27th Mar 2023).

Will continuously update this practice repository from time to time.
